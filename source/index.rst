**Geospatial Challenge Camp** is a 10-weeks long challenge-based course that aims to provide young researchers (doctoral and post-doctoral researchers, MSc students)
a chance to tackle relevant real-world challenges in cross-disciplinary teams. The participants from Finnish universities and research organisations will work in multidisciplinary teams
to identify and analyse complex location and time -related societal problems. The teams will co-design and build digital impact-driven solutions, which would improve the current know-how and
capabilities of managing these problems in the society. Researcher teams work actively with their peers, mentors and stakeholders during the camp and focus on designing geospatial data and digital technology solutions,
which could have sustainability impacts for the users of the solution and for the society at large.

The theme for the Geospatial Challenge Camp for year 2023 is **Health and Wellbeing**. Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and 
interconnectedness of both. In the challenge, the objective is to work towards integrating health and location data to support analysis and improvement of health and wellbeing. 
Possible application areas include air quality, climate change effects in urban planning, pandemic management, economic and social inequalities, and rapid urbanization.

Background
----------

Geospatial Challenge Camp is a new skills development and innovation service of `Geoportti Research Infrastructure <https://www.geoportti.fi/>`_ and Location Innovation Hub (LIH), which is one of the European Digital Innovation Hubs.
The goal of the Camp is to facilitate the growth of open data, technology and application innovations around Finnish research expertise and strengthen Finnish geospatial competence and innovation ecosystem through cross-fertilization of research,
innovation, business and sustainable development expertise around digital location data and technologies. The Geospatial Challenge Camp aims to link scientists from various disciplines to work on real-world sustainability challenges posed by societal actors,
data providers, companies, NGOs and innovation community actors. The challenge camp will facilitate the professional growth of young scientists and practitioners regarding the use of data, technology and application innovations stemming from the Finnish geospatial research expertise.
Challenges will offer researchers a chance to expand their data science solutions into new operative solutions and make a broader societal impact in Finland and beyond.

How is the camp organized?
--------------------------

The camp is 10 weeks long and equals 5 university credits (100-140 hours of work). Groups are formed from young researchers representing different universities, research organisations, disciplines and skills,
and they will work on real challenges and problems identified and confronted by different actors in the society. At the beginning of the camp, the groups will work together with these actors to define a more
detailed problem, which their group will try to solve. All solutions developed during the camp use and apply geospatial data and digital technologies. The groups will work independently to solve the problem and
finally present their solutions.

**Kick-off meeting**

The camp will start with a 2-day kick-off seminar and workshop on September 25-26th, 2023. This is hosted at Aalto University (Otaniemi Campus).

**Pitching**

The course will finish with the pitching of the solutions and follow-up discussions during December 5th, 2023 in Helsinki.

    * - Time
      - Content

    * - Week 1
      - - Kick-off event (September 25-26th, 2023) with introduction to the challenge theme, meeting with stakeholders, forming teams. A public seminar (half-a day) will be held first on Sep 25th with all the collaborators and researchers and Geoportti RI and LIH experts. Then a 1,5 day workshop with the researchers and Geoportti RI mentors (UTU, Aalto, FGI, SCS, SYKE, EUF) will follow.
        - Getting to know the societal context of the challenge, core data and tech options, Sustainable Development Goals relevance and linkages, etc.
        - At the end of the kick-off event the teams have been formed and they have arranged for initial means of communication and cooperation within the team. Teams start independent work, possibly consulting with appropriate experts from organizations that own the challenge.

    * - Week 2
      - - Challenge specification phase
        - Analyzing the broad challenge, learning insights, getting familiar with data and tools, etc
        - Specification of the team's problem/sub-challenge
        - Gathering resources, specifying stakeholders
        - At the end of this phase the teams have planned what they will be doing for the rest of the course and can proceed in their project

    * - Weeks 3-5
      - - Prototyping and rapid ideation of solutions
        - Testing data and tools
        - Validating ideas with stakeholders
        - At the end of this phase the teams know how they will solve the problem, will be able to present their approach to other students on the course and external stakeholders, and can start to develop the complete solution

    * - Mid-term Seminar
      - - November 1st, 2023
        - Each group presents their own project and prototyping/ideas in a physical meeting held either in Helsinki or Turku (to be confirmed). Full day seminar and feedback session with key mentors present
        - Discussions of the groups' work and a chance to see others group's work
        - Here each group needs to be far enough in their work that they can give a presentation on how they will solve the problem

    * - Weeks 6-9
      - - Team working to make a solution prototype 
        - Mentoring sessions

    * - Week 10
      - - Finalization and final seminar
        - Each group will present their solution to the rest of the course, stakeholders, and general audience during the Geoinformatics Research Days 2024
        - Any data, software demos etc. created will also be publicly distributed (unless otherwise agreed by the group, the stakeholders and the course staff)
        - Follow-up plans will also be presented, in order for the work to continued among interested parties
