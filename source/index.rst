Geospatial Challenge Camp Finland
=================================

**Geospatial Challenge Camp** is a 10-weeks long challenge-based course that aims to provide young researchers (doctoral and post-doctoral researchers, MSc students)
a chance to tackle relevant real-world challenges in cross-disciplinary teams. The participants from Finnish universities and research organisations will work in multidisciplinary teams
to identify and analyse complex location and time -related societal problems. The teams will co-design and build digital impact-driven solutions, which would improve the current know-how and
capabilities of managing these problems in the society.

Geospatial Challenge Camp is a new skills development and innovation service of Geoportti Research Infrastructure (https://www.geoportti.fi/) and Location Innovation Hub (LIH), which is one of the European Digital Innovation Hubs.
The goal of the Camp is to facilitate the growth of open data, technology and application innovations around Finnish research expertise and strengthen Finnish geospatial competence and innovation ecosystem through cross-fertilization of research,
innovation, business and sustainable development expertise around digital location data and technologies. The Geospatial Challenge Camp will link scientists from various disciplines to work on real-world sustainability challenges posed by societal actors,
data providers, companies, NGOs and innovation community actors. The challenge camp will facilitate the professional growth of young scientists and practitioners regarding the use of data, technology and application innovations stemming from the Finnish geospatial research expertise.
Challenges will offer researchers a chance to expand their data science solutions into new operative solutions and make a broader societal impact in Finland and beyond.
