General information
--------------------

The *Geospatial Challenge Camp* is a new skills development and innovation service of `Geoportti Research Infrastructure <https://www.geoportti.fi/>`_ 
and `Location Innovation Hub (LIH) <https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/locationinnovationhub>`_, which is one of the European Digital Innovation Hubs. 
The Geospatial Challenge Camp is a 10-week long challenge-based course (5 ECTS) that aims to provide participants a chance to tackle relevant 
real-world challenges in cross-disciplinary teams. The participants are doctoral and post-doctoral researchers plus master students 
from Finnish universities and research organizations. They will work together in multidisciplinary teams and 
collaborate with mentors and stakeholders.

The aims of the course:

- Identify and analyze complex location and time-related societal problems
- Design and build digital impact-driven solutions, which would improve the current know-how and capabilities of managing these problems in the society
- Link scientists from various disciplines to work on real-world sustainability challenges posed by societal actors, data providers, companies, NGOs and innovation community actors
- Facilitate the professional growth of young scientists and practitioners regarding the use of data, technology and application innovations stemming from the Finnish geospatial research expertise
- Offer researchers a chance to expand their data science solutions into new operative solutions and make a broader societal impact in Finland and beyond

The theme for the Geospatial Challenge Camp for year 2023 is **Health and Wellbeing**. In the challenge, 
the objective is to work towards integrating health and location data to support analysis and improvement 
of health and wellbeing. Possible application areas include:

- Air quality
- Climate change effects in urban planning
- Pandemic management
- Economic and societal inequalities
- Rapid urbanization

The benefits of the Geospatial Challange Camp:

- Facilitate the growth of open data, technology and application innovations around Finnish research expertise
- Strengthen Finnish geospatial competence and innovation ecosystem through cross-fertilization of research, innovation, business and sustainable development expertise around digital location data and technologies
