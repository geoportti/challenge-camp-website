        that aims to provide participants a chance to tackle relevant 
        real-world challenges in cross-disciplinary teams. 
        The participants are doctoral and post-doctoral researchers plus master students 
        from Finnish universities and research organizations. 
        They will work together in multidisciplinary teams and 
        collaborate with mentors and stakeholders.
        </p>

      <p>The course aims to identify and analyze complex location and 
        time-related societal problems that requires the designing 
        and building of digital impact-driven solutions, scientists from 
        various disciplines will work together on real-world sustainable solutions.
        Participants will benefit their professional growth regarding the use of data, 
        technology, and application innovations stemming from the Geoportti project.
        </p>

      <p>The challenges will be posed by societal actors, data providers, companies, 
        NGOs and innovation community actors and they will offer to Researchers the
