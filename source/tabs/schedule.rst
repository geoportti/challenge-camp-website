Data Science training at CSC
==============================

Geocomputing with Puhti supercomputer
---------------------------------------

.. raw:: html 

    <div>

        <p>
        In this course we will learn the basics of Geocomputing on a supercomputer through a combination of lectures 
        and hands-on activities. The main focus of the course is the <a href="https://docs.csc.fi/computing/systems-puhti/">Puhti supercomputer</a>,
        and all the exercises are hands-on. The CSC services discussed in this course are <a href="https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases">Free-of-charge for academic research, education, and training purposes</a> 
        for Finnish higher education Institutions and state research institutes (subsidized by the Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland).

        Most of the course content also applies to <a href="https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/">LUMI supercomputer</a>, which is available for academi users 
        and <a href="https://csc.fi/solutions-for-business">private business</a>. 

        This course is dedicated to academic researchers planning to use <b>Puhti supercomputer</b> and for data analysts 
        from private companies planning to use <b>LUMI supercomputer</b>. Take a look and undertands more about <a href="https://research.csc.fi/geocomputing">CSC geocomputing</a>.
