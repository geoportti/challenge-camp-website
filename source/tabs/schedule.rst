---------------------------------------

.. raw:: html 

    <div>

        <p>
        In this course we will learn the basics of Geocomputing on a supercomputer through a combination of lectures 
        and hands-on activities. The main focus of the course is the <a href="https://docs.csc.fi/computing/systems-puhti/">Puhti supercomputer</a>,
        and all the exercises are hands-on. The CSC services discussed in this course are <a href="https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases">Free-of-charge for academic research, education, and training purposes</a> 
        for Finnish higher education Institutions and state research institutes (subsidized by the Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland).

        Most of the course content also applies to <a href="https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/">LUMI supercomputer</a>, which is available for academi users 
        and <a href="https://csc.fi/solutions-for-business">private business</a>. 

        This course is dedicated to academic researchers planning to use <b>Puhti supercomputer</b> and for data analysts 
        from private companies planning to use <b>LUMI supercomputer</b>. Take a look and undertands more about <a href="https://research.csc.fi/geocomputing">CSC geocomputing</a>.

Learning outcomes
--------------------
After the course the participants should have the skills and knowledge needed to start using CSC supercomputer Puhti 
for their spatial analysis and spatial data processing tasks.
In detail, participants will learn:

- How to get account and access to Puhti (as part of the prerequisites).
- How to connect to a supercomputer, and where to store your data (Allas).
- How to use the modules and the batch job system.
- How to install own software to a supercomputer (Tykky).
- How to run your R or Python scripts or GDAL commands on one or several cores.
- How to use QGIS and other pre-installed GIS-software via the Puhti webinterface.
- How to get help.
