        Maximum **30 Researchers and Students** will be accepted to the Challenge Camp. Confirmation for accepted applicants
        will be sent on 28th January 2025.


Learning objectives
-------------------

- Students will work in multidisciplinary teams to identify and analyze complex locations and time-related societal challenges
- Aim is to design geospatial data and technology solutions from real-world challenges which could have sustainability impacts for the users of the solution and for the society at large
- Camp will link scientists from various disciplines with societal actors, data providers, companies, NGOs and innovation community actors
- Teams will present their ideas in the final seminar to the stakeholders, other teams and general audience

Learning outcomes
-----------------

After the course the students:

- have improved scientific skills in conceptualizing complex location-related problems in the society, and better understanding of how these problems can be tackled with geospatial data, geoprocessing, automation and digital technologies
- have technical, hands-on competencies to identify, use, assess, process and enrich geospatial data and digital technologies for their solution provision simultaneously addressing needs posed by the stakeholders of the challenge
- can plan and manage team work over several weeks with their own sub goals, milestones and deliverables, and recognize the roles and responsibilities of members in a project team, linked with the team deliverables
- have improved confidence to work in a multi-skilled team, knowing how to assess and communicate progress and results of the team work to stakeholders with diverse backgrounds

Credits
-------

Participation and completion of the course is 5 ECTS. PhD and MSc students will be granted the
credits by their own home institutions. Students not enrolled at any PhD or MSc programme
will need to discuss their arrangements with the challenge camp staff before signing up.
